- Split a fasta file for processing by BWA:

  $ docker run -it -v `pwd`:/data split-splice-fastq split -i <filename> -split 5

  This will mount your current working directory to the docker container and run the split app on a file named <filename> in your current work directory. The result will be 5 files in the same directory as <filename>.

- Splice a fasta file back into a single file:

  $ docker run -it -v `pwd`:/data split-splice-fastq splice -o <filename>
